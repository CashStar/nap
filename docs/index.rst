Accessing APIs open-endily is an easy affair. pip install requests, pass in your data get data back. But the slight differences and demands of different API creating code thatâ€™s structured, re-usable and simple proves difficult.

nap hopes to help.

nap aims to be:

* Support Read (GET) and Write (POST/PUT/PATCH)
* Little to no configuration needed for to-spec REST APIs
* Easy to configure to fit any REST-like API
* Customize to fit even edgier use cases
